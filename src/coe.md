The Correction of Error (CoE) process was inspired by the [AWS](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.coe.en.html) Well-Architected framework and acts as a [systematic method of learning](/doctrine#do-we-use-systematic-mechanisms-of-learning) for the organisation's service network.

## The Corrections of Error review

The [executive](/executive) will [conduct weekly reviews](/executive#review-correction-of-error-documents) of unreviewed Correction of Error documents.

This review will take place over 60 minutes, and will consider 2-3 randomly selected Corrections of Error. The relevant service manager will be expected to present the error, its correction, and then lead a discussion about the error with the attendees of the meeting. 

If a Correction of Error warrants further discussion, additional time may be scheduled to allow the discussion to take place.

This review allows other service managers to benefit from the experience of the error, without being a part of the service team that experienced the error. It also helps the Executive team to identify areas to consider future guidance.
