# Service manager role

**_Skills, responsibilities and purpose_**

Being a service manager is not a job, it is a _role_.

While some services may require specialist service managers frequently they start their careers in other professions. Consequently, a service manager may perform additional duties on a service team. For example, delivery managers and lead engineers both may be suitable candidates for the role.

## Purpose

Each service has a contract that defines the service, the needs it meets, and how users consume it. Service managers are **accountable** for delivery against that contract. Within the bounds of that contract, they are free to deliver the service as they see fit. The service is **autonomous** and operates independently.

The service manager understands the service’s users**.** They are able to identify who they are and what their user needs are. They can translate user stories and propose or consider approaches to meeting these needs. They engage in meaningful interactions and relationships with users, always putting them first.

## Responsibilities

The organisation’s executive requires services managers to:

* **Use the allocated service budget wisely.** Each service is allocated a budget by the[ executive](https://osom.guide/executive) and is responsible for ensuring it is used wisely. This budget should allow the service manager to build the team they need and perform any activities needed for its[ lifecycle stage](https://osom.guide/lifecycle).
* **Staffing & line management.** It is up to the service manager to staff the team as they see fit, with the people they need to perform the required activities. The cost of the team needs to be met from the budget that the service has been allocated. Members of the team are line-managed by the service manager, or by the management structure that the service manager puts in place. In all cases, the performance of team members should be considered in accordance with guidance from the[ community of practice](https://osom.guide/community-of-practice) that represents their profession.
* **Choose appropriate methods.** Different types of services require different approaches for different stages of[ evolution](https://osom.guide/evolution/) and different[ lifecycle](https://osom.guide/lifecycle/) phases. A novel service that addresses user needs in a completely new way requires different project methodologies, people, and techniques from the operation of a product or the management of a contract from a third-party supplier. The service manager is accountable for deciding the most appropriate way to run their team for their particular service.
* **Publish Correction of Error documents.** Building and running a service can be challenging, issues and problems occur regularly. To help the organisation learn in a methodical, systematic way, service managers write about the problems they face in[ Correction of Error](https://osom.guide/coe/) documents.
* **Publish measurements for the service.** Each service has relevant measurements recorded in its service contract. The service manager ensures that the values for those measurements are captured regularly, and[ reported in an appropriate way](https://osom.guide/measuring-service-performance/#recording-service-performance-measures/).
* **Ultimately be responsible** for the successful operation and continuous improvement of the service
