## Service managers

Service managers individually manage services. Ideally, the service
manager would have the capability to deliver every element of their
service - designing it, building or buying it, and then running it -
however, in practice, they must build and manage a team capable of
doing all of those things.

Service managers:

1. Are accountable for their service
2. Use the allocated service budget wisely
3. Build the team they need
4. Decide the way they run their team
5. Publish Correction of Error documents when problems arise
6. Publish measurements for their service

### Service managers are accountable for their service

Each service has a [contract](/service-contract) that defines the service, the needs it meets, and how users consume it. Service managers are accountable for delivery against that contract. Within the bounds of that contract, they are free to deliver the service as they see fit. The service is autonomous and operates independently.

### Service managers use the allocated service budget wisely

Each service is allocated a budget by the [executive](/executive) and is responsible for ensuring it is used wisely. This budget should allow the service manager to build the team they need and perform any activities needed for its [lifecycle stage](/lifecycle).

### Service managers build the team they need

Services need different capabilities at different times. For example, a service in [discovery](/lifecycle/#discovery) will have more user researchers than a [live](/lifecycle/#live) service; a service in [alpha ](/lifecycle/#alpha)or [beta ](/lifecycle/#beta)will probably
have more developers than a service that is live.

It is up to the service manager to staff the team as they see fit, with the people they need to perform the required activities. The cost of the team needs to be met from the budget that the service has been allocated.

Members of the team are line-managed by the service manager, or by the management structure that the service manager puts in place. In all cases, the performance of team members should be considered in accordance with guidance from the [community of practice](/community-of-practice) that represents their profession.

### Service managers decide the way they run their team

Different types of services require different approaches for different
stages of [evolution](/evolution/), and different [lifecycle](/lifecycle/) phases. A novel service that addresses user needs in a completely new way requires different project methodologies, people, and techniques from the operation of a product or the management of a contract from a third-party supplier.

For example, a service team building a beta web-based front-end that
interacts with end-users requires a different set of approaches to an
infrastructure cloud service that provides the front-end team with the
machines it uses.

The service manager is accountable for deciding the most appropriate
way to run their team for their particular service.

### Service managers publish Correction of Error documents when problems arise

Building and running a service is challenging at times, and issues and
problems occur regularly. To help the organisation learn in a
methodical, systematic way, service managers write about the problems
they face in [Correction of Error](/coe/) documents.

### Publish measurements for their service

Each service has relevant measurements recorded in its service contract. The service manager has to ensure that the values for those measurements are captured regularly, and [reported in an appropriate way](/measuring-service-performance/#recording-service-performance-measures/).

## Service manager role

**_Skills, responsibilities and purpose_**

Being a service manager is not a job, it is a _role_.

While some services may require specialist service managers frequently they start their careers in other professions. Consequently, a service manager may perform additional duties on a service team. For example, delivery managers and lead engineers both may be suitable candidates for the role.

### Purpose

Each service has a contract that defines the service, the needs it meets, and how users consume it. Service managers are **accountable** for delivery against that contract. Within the bounds of that contract, they are free to deliver the service as they see fit. The service is **autonomous** and operates independently.

The service manager understands the service’s users**.** They are able to identify who they are and what their user needs are. They can translate user stories and propose or consider approaches to meeting these needs. They engage in meaningful interactions and relationships with users, always putting them first.

### Responsibilities

The organisation’s executive requires services managers to:

* **Use the allocated service budget wisely.** Each service is allocated a budget by the[ executive](https://osom.guide/executive) and is responsible for ensuring it is used wisely. This budget should allow the service manager to build the team they need and perform any activities needed for its[ lifecycle stage](https://osom.guide/lifecycle).
* **Staffing & line management.** It is up to the service manager to staff the team as they see fit, with the people they need to perform the required activities. The cost of the team needs to be met from the budget that the service has been allocated. Members of the team are line-managed by the service manager, or by the management structure that the service manager puts in place. In all cases, the performance of team members should be considered in accordance with guidance from the[ community of practice](https://osom.guide/community-of-practice) that represents their profession.
* **Choose appropriate methods.** Different types of services require different approaches for different stages of[ evolution](https://osom.guide/evolution/) and different[ lifecycle](https://osom.guide/lifecycle/) phases. A novel service that addresses user needs in a completely new way requires different project methodologies, people, and techniques from the operation of a product or the management of a contract from a third-party supplier. The service manager is accountable for deciding the most appropriate way to run their team for their particular service.
* **Publish Correction of Error documents.** Building and running a service can be challenging, issues and problems occur regularly. To help the organisation learn in a methodical, systematic way, service managers write about the problems they face in[ Correction of Error](https://osom.guide/coe/) documents.
* **Publish measurements for the service.** Each service has relevant measurements recorded in its service contract. The service manager ensures that the values for those measurements are captured regularly, and[ reported in an appropriate way](https://osom.guide/measuring-service-performance/#recording-service-performance-measures/).
* **Ultimately be responsible** for the successful operation and continuous improvement of the service
